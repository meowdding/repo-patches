# Repo Patches

Patches for our bundled mod data, this should only be used for hofixes.
The patches should be organized with the following schema.

```
// in case it targets one specific mod
patches/<game_version>/<target>/<name/small description>.json(c)

// in case it targets multiple mods
patches/<game_version>/<name/small description>.json(c)
```
